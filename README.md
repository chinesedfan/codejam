### Introduction

I am not an ACMer, and I'm old. But I still keep attending [Google Codejam](https://code.google.com/codejam/).

My dream is just to win a T-shirt. :)

### Usage

Before 2018, `node a.js a.in > a.out`.

Start from 2018, `node a.js < a.in > a.out`. And it must obey syntax rules in Node.js 4.8.2.

For interactive problem,

- First appeared in 2018, `python testing_tool.py node a.js`

- Since 2019, `python interactive_runner.py python testing_tool.py 0 -- node a.js`
