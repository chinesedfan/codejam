#### Problem A. The Last Word

For each letter, if it is alphabetically before the previous one, place it at the last. Otherwise, insert it at first.

#### Problem B. Rank and File

If no row is missing, then each height should appear twice. Consider some heights may be the same, each height's count should be even. So just find those odd appearance heights and sort.

#### Problem C. BFFs

Find all circles by DFS, and consider following solutions: 1) circles whose size are greater than 2; 2) all circles whose size are 2, with chains that end on the circle.
